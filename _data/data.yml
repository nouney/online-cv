    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've worked for companies of different kinds and sizes: small, medium, large, young, old... This had helped me define what I really want to do and 
      how to do it. My favorite projects were the one that were at an early stage of their development, because I like being close to the customers and the product. 
      I enjoy moving from one technology to another, while keeping a pragmatic mindset to deliver the most optimized solution to the users.

    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've worked for companies of all kinds and shapes: small, medium, large, young, old... This had helped me define what I really want to do and 
      how to do it. My favorite projects were the one that were at a very early stage, I like being close to the customers and the product. I'm more interested by "what it does" rather than
      "how it", that's why I have no problem moving from one technology to another, while keeping a pragmatic mindset.

           - helped designing the product
           - designed and implemented the backend part of the product (GCP, Golang, Kubernetes)

          I have
           - migrated off MongoDB on to PostgreSQL, to use GCP more as a PaaS than a IaaS
           - participated in the microservice architecture

           - designed and implemented new features from scratch

          As the only developer, my mission in this early-stage start-up was to internalize the product that was developed by external developers.
          I have
           - managed the external developers for the transition
           - participated in the product roadmap

          - pick an infrastructure provider (GCP)
          - design and implement the backend (AppEngine, Golang, PostgreSQL)
          - implement the frontend (React)
          - create a basic data-pipeline for BI purposes
